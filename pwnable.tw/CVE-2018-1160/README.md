There is an old version Netatalk with some vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2018-1160.

Can you develop a 1-day exploit for this challenge? :p

The Kernel version is:
Linux ubuntu 4.9.0-x86_64-linode79 #1 SMP Mon Dec 12 13:17:30 EST 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Hint:
Notice, Kernel version may be changed after the environment updated.
You can get the current version from the the other challenge.
