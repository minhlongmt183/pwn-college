## Integers  
### Unsigned Integers  
- These types of integers are typically 32 bits wide and are designed to hold only positive numbers.
- An unsigned integer can be printed in Base-10 using the %u format specifier, or 0x%X for Base-16 (hexadecimal).  
### Signed Integers  
- Signed integers are slightly more nuanced than their unsigned counterparts. The most notable difference is that signed integers can hold both positive and negative numbers  
- signed integers have a smaller upper bound on positive values than unsigned integers.  
- the %d format specifier can be used to print signed integers in their native (positive/negative) Base-10 representation:
